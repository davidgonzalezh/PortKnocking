## Configuration File

Configurations are saved in a JSON file (`configurations.json`) with the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "configuration_name": {
            "ip": "target_ip_or_hostname",
            "ports": [
                ["protocol1", "port1"],
                ["protocol2", "port2"],
                ["protocol3", "port3"],
                ["protocol4", "port4"],
                ["protocol5", "port5"]
            ],
            "validation_port": "validation_port"
        }
    }
]
```

### Note: If the ports do not show correctly when you load a configuration, double-click the configuration host in the list, and the ports will display correctly.
